# what does your app do

In today's society, unhealthy habits have grown especially problematic, with heart issues becoming especially relevant.
The goal with Mercury is to provide a convenient method for worried individuals to formulate a defined understsanding on whether their health may actually be at risk of a cardiovascular disease. Similar to that of a BMI test, the results given by our application do not objectively represent one's risk but rather a metric to estimate your level of health. _This form is not applicable to any legal, scientific, or commercial uses_

## how does it work

The core component of our application relies on machine learning, and its ability to find correlation between a wide set of variables.
Our application works by parsing through a database provided by "Kaggle." The datafile given yields a variety of variables ranging from age, sex, cholesterol, and most importantly the presence, or absence, of heart disease. Thus, after a user inputs their own health metrics into our form, using TensorFlow, this information is compared to a wide variety of other inputs(given through Kaggle's database) to form a prediction on the user's likelihood of heart disease. To establish how the process exactly works, after the data is preprocessed into a form accessible to the computer, AI plays a central part in calculating results. Using a variety of machine-learning based algorithms, in which patterns are analyzed, our machine learning model develops a method to calculate how significant certain components are towards cardiovascular health.
